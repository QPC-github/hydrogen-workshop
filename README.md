# Hydrogen Workshop

Earlier this year Shopify announced Hydrogen, a web development framework optimized for building custom storefronts by Shopify. In this workshop you'll get a first look at Hydrogen and together we'll build a custom storefront using React Server Components, Vite and Tailwind CSS.

Get started by [forking this repository on Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/Shopify/hydrogen-workshop).
